## üí° Approach
Used a stack to track open brackets.
- When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack.
- If mismatched or empty at the wrong time ‚Üí invalid

---

## üß™ Edge Cases
- All candles are of the same height ‚Üí return the length of the list.
- Only one candle ‚Üí return 1.
- Heights in descending or random order ‚Üí still works, as we check only the max and its frequency.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
One pass to find the max, another to count.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
Only a few variables used.

---

## ‚ú® Learnings
- Use max() to easily find the largest value in a list.
- list.count(value) is a clean way to count occurrences.
- Breaking problems into small steps (find max, count max) simplifies the logic.
